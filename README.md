Welcome to my repository.

This repository is not yet complete and will be updated as more activities are carried out.

Here you can find my solutions to the exercises proposed by the professors during the year of my master's degree at Cambridge University (Mphil Data Intensive Science), as well as recommendations of books or articles depending on the topic. You can also find links to pages with interesting information or datasets.

I hope this repository will help you during your studies.

Best of luck and lots of motivation to achieve all your goals!
